        <p><em>October 5 is the day on which the whole SEO industry in Poland breath again, and the owners of many
            websites caught his head. The reason for all this confusion was a big update Google Penguin targeted at poor
            quality junk profiles links. The official announcement on Twitter Matt Cuts, head of the fight against spam
            in search results, today announced that version 2.1 of the Penguin was to cover only 1 % of the results.
            One could expect that some of the pages fall out of position.</em></p>

        <h2>Why is my website down?</h2>

        <p>The first version of the Penguin was introduced in early 2012. Its aim was to push for lower positions of
            pages that have been promoted by the low quality links (SEO directories, pretzels, hand built exclusively
            for positioning and those of the so-called exact match anchor text) and those that are not updated
            regularly and do not contain high dose content. Risk of falling were also part excessive optimization, which
            unceremoniously overloaded links. The new version of the algorithm seemed to focus on the same factors, but
            her actions were more specific and stronger. Looking at the ongoing industry discussions you suspect that
            the update could be affected by even 30% of the sites have been high in the search engine. Because of the
            red bars charts, showing a decrease in number of pages - October 5 has been hailed as the "Red Saturday".

        <h2>Defense against Penguin</h2>

        <p>Search engine optimization is an attempt to fight the search engine algorithm. Often, these measures are not
            in accordance with the Terms. Often we have to decide whether you want a low cost and in a short time to
            get the maximum results for your chosen keywords if we want stability, which, however, is associated with
            higher prices and longer waiting. The first solution is obviously tempting, but the current change seems
            to be the only fight against windmills. So if you have decided on your SEO efforts, you should keep in mind
            to avoid massive collection of links (especially low quality), obtaining a large number of links with
            anchor text or links containing keywords Commercial and pushy scraping the keyword in the title, the
            description of the same content.

        <h2>What to do?</h2>

        <p>It is difficult to provide a universal solution to decrease due to the updating of the algorithm, as it
            should always be preceded by a previous SEO efforts. In general, sites that have become a victim can be
            divided into two groups: those that have fallen by tens or even hundreds of items and those that were only
            a dozen or so sites below. In the former case it will be necessary to remove harmful links that led to the
            imposition of the penalty. In the second case probably will not have to deal with any penalty and search
            engine positions decreased by excluding the importance of artificial links. It is therefore more weight
            applied to the substantive content and the Internet users themselves will be sites link to it.</p>
