        <p><em>On October 5th the whole SEO industry held it's breath and the owners of many
            websites pulled their hair in disbelief as their sites vanished from Google's natural search results.
            The culprit - the Penguin. Google decided to roll out a major update to it's black-hat SEO banning
            algorithm. The update was officially announced on Twitter by Matt Cutts (<a
                    href="http://twitter.com/mattcutts" class="look__twitter">@mattcutts</a>), the lead of the
            spam-fighting team announced that Penguin 2.1 will only affect about 1% of the search engine's results.
            If you calculate that into absolute numbers - about 400 million web pages went down in ranks.</em></p>

        <h2>Why is my website gone?</h2>

        <p>The first version of Penguin was introduced in early 2012. Its aim was to push down pages that have been
            promoted by low quality links (SEO directories, pretzel pages and artificial manual linking vi anchor
            texts), pages which are not updated in a regular manner and those that don't contain original content. About
            that time everyone was afraid that Google will over-optimize the algorithm. The new release seems to focus
            on the same factors but the impact is much stronger. The mentioned above 1% of results seems to be strongly
            condensed in the first few pages of results. Because of the world-wide red bars charts in SEO site
            statistics - October 5 has been announced the "Red Saturday".

        <h2>Anti-Penguin Defense</h2>

        <p>Let's be honest: search engine optimization is an attempt to fight the search engine's algorithms. It is not
            uncommon that the taken measures brake the rules set by Google to prevent spam. There's a big pressure to
            provide visible results in short time, but these strategies always fail when there's an algorithm update.
            The trick is to promote the site with valuable content from valuable sources over a prolonged period of
            time. You should at all cost avoid link-directory clusters with anchor linking and link-bots that create
            content
            from your site's meta-tags. Provide value with content - and you'll be rewarded.

        <h2>The aftermath</h2>

        <p>We can categorize the new Penguin's impact into two groups: sites that have dropped "only" a few pages in the
            results and sites that have dropped over 100 positions. If you're in the first group then there's no reason
            to panic: just cleanup all the junk links and soon your site should climb up. If you're in the latter group
            however you should consider a remap of the site's structure or maybe even a new domain name (with updated
            content!).</p>
